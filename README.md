# UsingRedCap
Using RedCap API with R for relational data

RedCap https://www.project-redcap.org/ is a web based data collection instrument.
It stores data in a flat file like a spreadsheet.
It does not provide the ability to link datasets. This is expected to be done externally.
The most promising method for achieving this is the RedCap API.

This project will attempt to learn/document the process and provide use/implementation.
